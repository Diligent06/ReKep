# Explanation:
# The task is "pick up block on the table".
# This involves:
# 1. Grasping the block (grasping must be an independent stage).
# 2. Lifting the block up from the table.
# Therefore, there are 2 stages:
# - Stage 1: Grasp the block.
# - Stage 2: Lift the block up.

✅ **Summary**:
- **2 stages**: grasp block → lift block.
- **Grasp keypoint**: 0 (block).
- **No release** needed after lifting (unless specified otherwise).
