```python
# Explanation:
# The task is "pick up block on the table".
# Picking up requires two stages:
# 1. Grasp the block (grasping must be an independent stage).
# 2. Lift the block up from the table.

num_stages = 2

### stage 1 sub-goal constraints (grasping the block)
def stage1_subgoal_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """Align the end-effector with the block (keypoint 0)."""
    target_keypoint = keypoints[0]
    cost = np.linalg.norm(end_effector - target_keypoint)
    return cost

### stage 1 path constraints
# No path constraints needed for grasping stage.

### stage 2 sub-goal constraints (lifting the block)
def stage2_subgoal_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """Lift the block (keypoint 0) 10cm above its original position."""
    lifted_position = keypoints[0] + np.array([0, 0, 0.10])  # 10cm above
    cost = np.linalg.norm(keypoints[0] - lifted_position)
    return cost

### stage 2 path constraints
def stage2_path_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """Ensure the robot is still grasping the block (keypoint 0) while lifting."""
    return get_grasping_cost_by_keypoint_idx(0)

"""
Summarize keypoints to be grasped in all grasping stages.
The length of the list should be equal to the number of stages.
For grasping stage, write the keypoint index. For non-grasping stage, write -1.
"""
grasp_keypoints = [0, -1]

"""
Summarize at **the end of which stage** the robot should release the keypoints.
The keypoint indices must appear in an earlier stage as defined in `grasp_keypoints`.
Only release object when it's necessary to complete the task.
"""
release_keypoints = [-1, -1]
```

**Notes:**
- Stage 1 is grasping the block (keypoint 0).
- Stage 2 is lifting the block 10cm above its original position.
- No release is needed because the task is just to pick up, not to place or drop the block.
