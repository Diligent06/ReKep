```python
# Explanation:
# The task is "pick up block on the table".
# This involves 2 stages:
# 1. Grasp the block (grasping must be an independent stage).
# 2. Lift the block up from the table.

num_stages = 2

### stage 1 sub-goal constraints (grasp the block)
def stage1_subgoal_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """Align the end-effector with the block (keypoint 0)."""
    target_keypoint = keypoints[0]
    cost = np.linalg.norm(end_effector - target_keypoint)
    return cost

### stage 1 path constraints
# No path constraints needed for grasping stage.

### stage 2 sub-goal constraints (lift the block)
def stage2_subgoal_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """Lift the block (keypoint 0) 10cm above its original position."""
    original_position = keypoints[0]
    desired_position = original_position + np.array([0, 0, 0.10])  # 10cm above
    cost = np.linalg.norm(keypoints[0] - desired_position)
    return cost

### stage 2 path constraints
def stage2_path_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """The robot must still be grasping the block (keypoint 0)."""
    return get_grasping_cost_by_keypoint_idx(0)

"""
Summarize keypoints to be grasped in all grasping stages.
The length of the list should be equal to the number of stages.
For grasping stage, write the keypoint index. For non-grasping stage, write -1.
"""
grasp_keypoints = [0, -1]

"""
Summarize at **the end of which stage** the robot should release the keypoints.
The keypoint indices must appear in an earlier stage as defined in `grasp_keypoints`.
Only release object when it's necessary to complete the task.

release_keypoints = [-1, -1]
``` 

---
✅ In this case, the robot does not need to release the block after lifting it — it just needs to pick it up.  
✅ Grasping is separated into its own stage.  
✅ Constraints are simple and directly related to the task.
